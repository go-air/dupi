# ‚äß dupi

Dupi is an engine for identifying and exploring duplicative text in sets of
documents.

## Status

Dupi is in alpha/early beta development stage.  Please feel free to give it a try
(and [file issues](https://github.com/go-air/dupi/issues)).  We have run it on
several document sets successfully, but it definitely needs more testing.

## Input

Throw hundreds of thousands of textual documents at it.  Or extract text from
other documents and send that to dupi.

## Output

Find and query for repeated chunks of text.
